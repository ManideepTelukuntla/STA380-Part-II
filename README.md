## 1. Introduction 
In our "Introduction to Machine Learning" assignment, we have undertaken a comprehensive examination of the fundamental aspects of ML. This exploration spans the foundational principles of probability, advanced data wrangling techniques, the art of visual storytelling, methodologies in clustering and topic modeling, and the intricacies of neural networks. We invite you to delve into our repository for a detailed analysis and insights.

## 3. Overview
### [Probability practice](https://github.com/kkarthick12/STA380-Part-II/blob/main/Q1-Probability.ipynb)
​
**Description:** 
- For our analysis, we employed the Rule of Total Probability to deduce the fraction of truthful clickers responding "yes" in a website survey scenario (Part A). Subsequently, we harnessed Bayes' Theorem to assess the likelihood of a disease presence given a positive test result, considering both the test's sensitivity and the disease's prevalence (Part B).
​
**Conclusions/Results:**
* The fraction of people who are truthful clickers answered yes is 71.43%
* The probability of someone having disease given that they tested positive is 19.89%

### [The Reuters Corpus](https://github.com/kkarthick12/STA380-Part-II/blob/main/Q7-The%20Reuters%20Corpus.ipynb)
​
**Description:**
- For the Reuters C50 text corpus, we employed the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to perform topic modeling, identifying key themes across the corpus. Leveraging these discerned topics, we also designed a mini search engine that suggests authors based on user-input topics, enabling a targeted exploration of the dataset's content.
​
**Conclusions/Results:**
- Through LDA topic modeling, we discerned predominant themes in the Reuters C50 corpus, spanning U.S. business legalities, global financial trends, and geopolitical nuances, especially concerning China. This analysis paved the way for a tailored search system to connect users with authors specializing in their chosen topics.
