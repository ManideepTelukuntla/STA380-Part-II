Q4. Visual story telling part 2: Capital Metro data
================

The file capmetro_UT.csv contains data from Austinâ€™s own Capital Metro
bus network, including shuttles to, from, and around the UT campus.
These data track ridership on buses in the UT area. Ridership is
measured by an optical scanner that counts how many people embark and
alight the bus at each stop. Each row in the data set corresponds to a
15-minute period between the hours of 6 AM and 10 PM, each and every
day, from September through November 2018. The variables are:

    timestamp: the beginning of the 15-minute window for that row of data
    boarding: how many people got on board any Capital Metro bus on the UT campus in the specific 15 minute window
    alighting: how many people got off ("alit") any Capital Metro bus on the UT campus in the specific 15 minute window
    day_of_week and weekend: Monday, Tuesday, etc, as well as an indicator for whether it's a weekend.
    temperature: temperature at that time in degrees F
    hour_of_day: on 24-hour time, so 6 for 6 AM, 13 for 1 PM, 14 for 2 PM, etc.
    month: July through December

Your task is to create a figure, or set of related figures, that tell an
interesting story about Capital Metro ridership patterns around the
UT-Austin campus during the semester in question. Provide a clear
annotation/caption for each figure, but the figure(s) should be more or
less stand-alone, in that you shouldnâ€™t need many, many paragraphs to
convey its meaning. Rather, the figure together with a concise caption
should speak for itself as far as possible.

You have broad freedom to look at any variables youâ€™d like here â€“ try to
find that sweet spot where youâ€™re showing genuinely interesting
relationships among more than just two variables, but where the
resulting figure or set of figures doesnâ€™t become
overwhelming/confusing. (Faceting/panel plots might be especially useful
here.)

Weekends have significantly low numbers of both boarding and alighting.
This might be because people use buses as their mode of commute to
college and colleges function on weekdays. Boarding and Alighting
numbers follow together as people who board has to eventually alight.

observable trend indicating preferred temperature ranges for travel?**

Lowest boarding is at sub zero level and the trend of boarding increases
as the temperature increases gradually. Maximum ridership is seen at
30-35 degree celsius. As it exceeds, the ridership falls drastically
below.

**What role do seasonal changes and specific events, such as Halloween,
play in affecting ridership trends?**

``` r

Primary axis represents the scale for boxplot and secondary axis
represents weather temperature. Intuitively, we expect boarding numbers
to fall down with drop in temperature. But despite the temperature
falling down, since October is a month for Halloween, the boarding
numbers could be rising up before it falls down, as expected in
November.

We knew that people travel less during weekend Does the trend remain the
same for weekend as well?

``` r

  summarise(meanBoarding = mean(boarding))

    ## the `.groups` argument.

``` r
captionText <- "Whether or not its weekend, the trend of number of people who board seems to grow as the temperature increases. This could also be amplified by the fact we saw earlier that people tend to board more during midday. And during midday, the temperature goes up."
